# SIO112_python
## SIO 112 Class notes examples translated from Matti's Matlab code into Python notebooks

Python is a pretty awesome data science tool that comes with plenty of versatility. You can see about downloading it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

These examples are going to be maintanined in Juypter notebooks. Juypter notebooks are a pretty handy user development enviroment that allows for personal notebook arrangment through JuypterLab. I would recommend downloading Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads) to get started with the JuypterLab. 

There are various enviorments that should be set up so that everything runs smoothly. And this setup is typically ran with something like git bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads), which will also help with cloning this repository if one wishes to do so.
