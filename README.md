## SIO 112 Class notes examples translated from Matti's Matlab code into Python notebooks

Python is a pretty awesome data science tool that comes with plenty of versatility. I have used a Jupyter Notebook for each chapter of notes so far which can be viewed under 'notebooks', here, they can be viewed and downloaded. The data files used in each notebook are under 'data'.

### Using Python
You can see about downloading python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads if you want to get started in JupyterLab. Jupyter notebooks are a pretty handy user development enviroment that allows for personal notebook arrangement through JupyterLab. I would recommend downloading Anaconda to get started with the JupyterLab. 

There are various environments that should be set up so that everything runs smoothly. And this setup is typically ran with something like git bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads), which will also help with cloning this repository if one wishes to do so.
