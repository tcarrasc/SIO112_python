## SIO 112 Class notes examples translated for Python

Python is another data science tool, like MATLAB, that comes with plenty of versatility. Here you will find Jupyter Notebooks that contain the code examples from Chapters 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 written in Python. The notebooks can be viewed under the 'notebooks' folder and the data files used in each notebook are under the 'data' folder. For best use of the notebooks, download the two folders together onto your machine so that the data import path in each notebook holds true.

### Using Python
If this is your first time considering the language, you can see about downloading python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. The Anaconda interface is often recommended to help maintain the packages and environments required for python as well as accessing the web based environment, JupyterLab. Anaconda can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads. JupyterLab is one way to access Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are a pretty handy user development environment that allow for personal notebook arrangement. 

There are various environments that should be set up so that everything runs smoothly. This setup is typically ran with something like git bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads), which will also help with cloning this repository if one wishes to do so. More on installing Python, Anaconda, and git along with other Python basics can be found at SIO's Lisa Tauxe's python survival skills page: https://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-docs/resources/survival_skills.html#introduction-to-python-programming.

Surely the professor will be able to answer any code questions that may come up as you go through these notebooks, but feel free to reach out with any extraneous questions (tcarrasc@ucsd.edu).

Enjoy!
